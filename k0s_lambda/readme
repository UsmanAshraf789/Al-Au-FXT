1) mudstv0xifinder:
The codes for K0s, Lambda, from MuDst.
To compile, use 'starver SL16k_embed', 'cons'.
To submit the jobs, first create directories "batch", "log", "output", 
then use 'star-submit Scheduler.xml', the "output" directory contains the picodst.root files for further offline analysis.

2) offlinecut:
The code for applying further offline cuts for K0s/Lambda on the picodst.root, and filling invariant mass histograms.
To run it, one needs to first generate the list of the picodst.root files, for example, the 'finished_ks.list/finished_ksrot.list' for K0s,
then 'starver SL16k_embed', 'cons' to compile the code under StRoot (for StRefMultCorr), finally use './runcuts.sh ks' to run the 'cuts_ks_cut0.C' script. The code for Lambda is 'cuts_la_cut0.C',  use './runcuts.sh la' to run them. The output is the histogram root files under 'output' directory.(cut0 is only for rapidly bin -1.75 to -1.5, one need to change the rapidity bin i.e. 0.25unit to get the spectra at other rapidity bins)
one should run them one after another.


3) embedpicocut:
To estimate the efficiency, one need to get the embedding. It will generate the 'k0sfp_100_114.pico.list' for K0s flat pT sample and 'k0sexp_100_111.pico.list' for K0s exp. pT sample. 
use './runcuts.sh ks' to run the 'cuts_ks_cut0.C' script. The code for Lambda is 'cuts_la_cut0.C', use './runcuts.sh la' to run them to calculate the efficiency. 
The output is the .txt files under 'output' directory.(cut0 is only for rapidly bin -1.75 to -1.5, one need to change the rapidity bin i.e. 0.25unit to get the spectra at other rapidity bins)

4) spectra:
'ks' directory is the code for Ks, one needs to download both the histo.root (from step 2) and weight*txt (from step 4) to 'output' subdirectory. The script 'draws_ks_cut0.C' is for invariant mass fitting and signal yield extraction. The scripts 'spectra_ks_corr_low_cut0.C', 'spectra_ks_corr_high_cut0.C', and 'spectra_ks_corr_all_cut0.C' is for obtaining the pT spectra and yields, one should run them one after another.(cut0 is only for rapidly bin -1.75 to -1.5, one need to change the rapidity bin i.e. 0.25unit to get the spectra at other rapidity bins)
one should run them one after another.
'la' directory is the code for Lambda , one needs to download both the histo.root (from step 2) and weight*txt (from step 4) to 'output' subdirectory. The script 'draws_la_cut0.C' is for invariant mass fitting and signal yield extraction. The scripts 'spectra_la_corr_low_cut0.C', 'spectra_la_corr_high_cut0.C', and 'spectra_la_corr_all_cut0.C' is for obtaining the pT spectra and yields, one should run them one after another.(cut0 is only for rapidly bin -1.75 to -1.5, one need to change the rapidity bin i.e. 0.25unit to get the spectra at other rapidity bins)

For systematic errors, one should change the analysis cuts, and check the variations of pT spectra, see analysis note for details.
